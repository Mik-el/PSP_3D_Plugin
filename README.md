# PSP 3D Plugin
This "Driver" allows to play games in Stereoscopic/Anagliph 3D on your PSP or PSP Go! (Play Station Portable)


# 3D Features:
- Multiple Anagliph modes (red/cyan ...)
- Adjustable 3D disparity (intensity of 3D)
- Adjustable Convergence

# Pros:
- Stereoscopic 3D!
- Cheap!

# Cons:
- Increases resource usage and battery drain

# Compatibilty:
- You need a PSP with a custom firmware installed. (The most recent custom firmwares are TN-EN and PRO, up to PRO-B5. They are supported by the plugin. I suggest you to install the "temporary" version so the custom firmware unloads everytime you shut down the PSP completely).
